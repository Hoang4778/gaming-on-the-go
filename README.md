# Gaming on the go

## Description

This is by far my most dedicated project - a demo app of an e-commerce website selling gaming laptops. The idea came from my interests with gaming laptops specifically, the website is more about showcasing top notch products on the market than selling the mid-scale stuff for regular use.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

## Functionalities of this site

1. Users can click through products to preview and pick the right ones.
2. The products can be sorted based on alphabetical order or price order.
3. Products can be added to cart, modified by quantity and got rid of cart due to customer preference.
4. Users can sign up for an account, log in when they need to, manage their account by adding avatar, phone number, changing password and username.
5. The site can perform the procedure from selecting products, sign up, to checkout.
6. User data and cart items are stored on Firestore database and localStorage respectively, so the next time users access the website, it is still there for them to continue their shopping.

## Project status

This project is finished and available for referencing and testing.
